          🚀 My Journey to GSoC 2026
        </h1>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed mb-8">
          When I first heard about Google Summer of Code (GSoC), it sounded like a dream — working with open-source organizations, writing real production code, and learning from industry-level mentors. But for me, it became more than just a program — it became a goal that keeps me moving forward every single day.

          🌱 Where It All Started
        </h2>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Just a few months ago, I didn't even know HTML or CSS properly. I was a beginner, curious but completely unsure where to start.
          But I had one thing — <strong>clarity of purpose</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I wanted to grow as a developer, contribute to something meaningful, and eventually become a part of the open-source world.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          That's when I started my journey with the <strong>Sigma Web Dev Course by CodeWithHarry</strong>. I dedicated myself to learning every topic — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and even Next.js.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-[#780016] font-bold text-xl italic mb-8">
          Every single day was about progress — not perfection.
        </p>

          💻 Building Projects, Building Confidence
        </h2>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Learning is one thing. Building something out of it is another.
          I began creating small projects and gradually moved to full-stack apps like:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="space-y-3 mb-6 ml-6">
          <li className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex items-start">
            <span className="text-green-600 font-bold mr-3">✅</span>
            Password Manager
          </li>
          <li className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex items-start">
            <span className="text-green-600 font-bold mr-3">✅</span>
            URL Shortener
          </li>
          <li className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex items-start">
            <span className="text-green-600 font-bold mr-3">✅</span>
            LinkTree Clone
          </li>
          <li className="text-gray-700 text-lg flex items-start">
            <span className="text-green-600 font-bold mr-3">✅</span>
            My Personal Portfolio
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Each project made me more confident and taught me how all the pieces of web development fit together. These weren't just assignments — they were proof of growth.

          🧠 Why GSoC 2026?
        </h2>
        
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For me, GSoC 2026 isn't just a resume line — it's about learning at scale, collaborating with real developers, and giving back to the same community that helped me learn so much.

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">

          This journey is far from over — in fact, it's just beginning.
          Every day I open my laptop, write a few lines of code, or fix a bug, I know I'm one step closer to that goal.

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          GSoC isn't the destination — it's the milestone on my path to becoming a better developer, a better learner, and eventually, a contributor to something bigger than myself.

        <p className="text-[#780016] font-bold text-xl mb-8">
          So here's to the grind, the code, and the consistency.

          </h2>
          
          <p className="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If you're just starting out and aiming for GSoC, here's what I've learned so far:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="space-y-4">
            <li className="text-white text-lg">
              <strong>🌱 Start small.</strong> Contribute to documentation or fix small bugs first — it builds confidence.
            </li>
            <li className="text-white text-lg">
              <strong>🧠 Master one stack deeply.</strong> Don't chase every new framework — depth beats breadth.
            </li>
            <li className="text-white text-lg">
              <strong>💬 Engage with the community.</strong> Join Discord/Slack groups, read issues, and talk to mentors.
            </li>
            <li className="text-white text-lg">
              <strong>🧩 Build personal projects.</strong> They teach you structure, problem-solving, and debugging.
            </li>
            <li className="text-white text-lg">
              <strong>⏳ Be consistent.</strong> Even one hour a day adds up — momentum matters more than motivation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p className="text-white text-xl font-bold mt-6 italic">
            Remember, it's not about being the smartest — it's about being the one who shows up every day and keeps learning.
